        <br>
        #Materials + Special Requirements

        * If learners want to save their projects, they will need an email address to create a free Glitch account.
        * Google Cardboard or other VR viewers for DEMOS (ideal ratio = 1 viewer: 2 learners)

        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, use the following modifications:

        * Copy over learner files onto all computers (link on Welcome slide).
        * Ensure that [Atom](http://atom.io) is installed on all computers.
        * Have learners add the `offline-starter-code` project folder in Atom.
        * Learners can preview their project by opening the starter code `index.html` in their browser.
        * Use the images in the `assets` folder as textures.
        * Unzip the `aframe-documentation` folder and reference this instead of the online documentation.
        * If possible, install a few VR apps on phones for the VR Viewers section. [Here are some recommended VR apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Uo_07zebpE7xwZWkCsECMCbnfwh3N57JqCZGwnDPmo/edit?usp=sharing).
        * Please remind learners to save often!

        #Notes:

        **Introductions:**
        Introduce yourself and your team.

        Say: “Today, we are coming to you live, virtually, and in your homes!”

        If you are comfortable, share where you are calling from with learners!

        Tips & Tricks
        When saying ‘in your homes’, considering making use of your verbal and nonverbal communication tactics. For example, you could grab your laptop and bring your face closer to the screen, raising the volume of your voice and the intensity of your emotion.

        **Coders’ Code**
        Say: “Before we begin coding, we have to review our Coders’ Code.”

        Ask: “What do you think our Coders’ Code is? Why do you think it is important?” (A: The Coders’ Code is a set of guidelines established at the beginning of each workshop that highlights the type of behaviour expected from learners. We ask all learners to follow these guidelines whether they are 2 or 200 years old! By following the code, we can create a safe space where we all feel comfortable, confident, and at our best.)

        Review the Coder’s Code:

        Be respectful, friendly, and welcoming.
        Say: “Help create a welcoming, inclusive, safe(r) space for everyone in the workshop. Of course, this includes being friendly and welcoming, but also choosing our words and actions with care. When unmuting to speak or posting in the chat, use ‘THINK’! Is it True? Is it Helpful? Is it inspiring? Is it Necessary? Is it Kind? Remember: physical, sexual, and verbal harassment are unacceptable. We do not discriminate against others because of their identity (race, gender, sexuality, age, class, ability, religion, etc.)”

        Be mindful of how much space you are taking up
        Say: “If you are someone who tends to speak up a lot, maybe challenge yourself to take a step back and let someone else have the floor. If you tend to be quieter, challenge yourself to participate more than you would normally.”

        Ask questions
        Ask: “Can someone remind me of the ways we can ask for help in our virtual classroom?” (A: We can raise our virtual hands or we can post a question in the chat.)

        Take care of your body
        Say: “Staring at a screen for too long can be hard on our eyes, just as sitting still for too long can make us sore!”
        Ask: “How can we keep our eyes and bodies healthy when using a computer? What has worked for you?”
        Say: “Today, we are asking you to get up and stretch often! Look away from the screen every now and then! We will encourage this with fun activities throughout the workshop.”

        * No photos or audio/video recordings
        Say: “This is very important! Respect the privacy of others in this workshop who have not given consent for their face or voice to be shared online.”

        Ask: “Is there anything else you feel we should add to our Coders’ Code? What do you need from me (or your colleagues) to learn in this environment?”

        Asking learners to agree on their own additional criteria will:
        Account for diversity in your audience from workshop-to-workshop
        Help with buy-in

        Refer back to the Coders’ Code if there are issues during the workshop.

        **Circle of Knowledge Submission:**
        At the end of the workshop we will have a question person to have a candid conversation amongst learners and the facilitation team. During this time, encourage learners to do any of the following:

        * Share or ask for guidance/recommendations regarding next steps for their projects
        * Ask the facilitation team their burning tech-related questions
        * Shoutout mentors or fellow learners

        Learners are asked to submit questions at any time during the workshop to the producer (via private Zoom message). Remind learners although questions will be anonymous to other learners however, the questions are not anonymous to CLC staff.

        **Today's Project:**
        Open link to project. This is an example of what we could make (virtual ice cream cone!). Learners can create this or whatever virtual world they can imagine.

        **Artist Profile:** Share an example artist (Scott) that uses VR to create immersive experiences. Watch the video clip of his example - keeping in mind that this is just a recording of the project, not the actual VR experience.

        For pronounciation of Benesiinaabandan, see http://www.native-languages.org/ojibwe_guide.htm (estimated pronounciation: Bay-nay-seen-aww-buhn-duhn).

        Ask learners: What stood out? What do you think is going on in this piece? (Here's a video of Scott explaining what it is about: [https://vimeo.com/247365954](https://vimeo.com/247365954))

        **VR:** Show each of the examples linked.

        **Today’s Approach:**

        Review scaffolding structure of workshop. This structure is key to saving on troubleshooting time later (which is very difficult to do virtually!).

        Say: “Anytime I introduce a new concept, we will work through the problem together on my screen first. Then, you will be given some time to apply the concept to your own project independently.”


        **Intro to A-Frame:** WebVR is VR that we can build and experience in our browser.

        **Remix the Starter project:** Glitch will save a cached version of their website in their browser, but only temporarily. They will not be able to continue their project later unless they create an account and log in.

        See slide at the end of the workshop on how to optionally create an account and save.

        Optional login info for instructors:<br>
        *Username:* teenslc-toronto<br>
        *Password:* Helloteens123

        **What do you see?** Learners should have some experience with HTML &amp; CSS (as a prerequisite). Some of these HTML elements and formatting should look familiar, otherwise review using slide 16.

        **Challenge:** Give learners 5 minutes to tinker with the starter code and complete as many of these challenges as they can.

        Have volunteer learners come up to the front to share their solutions.

        **Experience your Virtual World!:** Give learners time to set up and experience their own projects using VR Viewers before sharing with others. Mentors can each 'own' a viewer to help with sharing them equally. If loaner phones aren't available, learners and mentors can connect to the internet on their own mobile devices (whoever has them and is comfortable).

        **Circle of Knowledge:**

        Provide time for a candid conversation amongst learners and the facilitation team. During this time, answer questions which were sent in throughout the workshop +  encourage learners to ask questions:

        * Share or ask for guidance/recommendations regarding next steps for their projects
        * Ask the facilitation team their burning tech-related questions
        * Shoutout mentors or fellow learners

        **DEMOS:** Have learners set up their projects on the VR Viewers viewers as stations in the classroom and provide 10-15 minutes for learners to experience each other's virtual worlds.

        **Optional: Sign in to save:** If you have time, or want to make time, learners can continue editing their project by creating an account and savinging their project. They can rename their project once they have logged in to save. If that doesn't work, they can also Remix a copy of the original project.
